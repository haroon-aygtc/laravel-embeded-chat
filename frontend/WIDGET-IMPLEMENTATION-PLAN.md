# Chat Widget Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for completing the chat widget functionality for production use. We are standardizing on `ChatWidgetWithConfig` as our primary widget component and removing the older `ChatWidget` implementation.

## Current Status

We have:
- Deprecated the original `ChatWidget` component
- Created a new export in `components/chat/index.ts` that exports `ChatWidgetWithConfig` as `ChatWidget` for backward compatibility
- Updated references in WebComponentWrapper and chat-embed.tsx

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (1-2 days)

1. **Fix Configuration Loading**
   - Complete proper config loading in ChatWidgetWithConfig
   - Ensure widgetClientService.getWidgetConfig updates widget state correctly
   - Fix type definitions for config object to match the backend API

2. **Fix WebSocket Integration**
   - Fix WebSocket URL construction
   - Ensure proper reconnection logic
   - Add REST API fallbacks when WebSockets are unavailable

3. **Fix Embed Code Generation**
   - Complete the `generateEmbedCode` method in WidgetService
   - Test embed code functionality
   - Ensure proper widget identification in embed code

### Phase 2: Domain Validation & Security (2-3 days)

1. **Implement Domain Validation**
   - Test existing domain validation logic
   - Fix wildcard domain support
   - Ensure proper referrer checking

2. **Session Management**
   - Fix session creation and management
   - Ensure proper authentication for private widgets
   - Implement session persistence

### Phase 3: User Experience (2-3 days)

1. **Follow-up Questions**
   - Complete follow-up questions implementation
   - Ensure proper UI rendering
   - Test question selection and responses

2. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Fix any visual glitches
   - Ensure proper mobile responsiveness
   - Test on various screen sizes and browsers

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Widget loads correctly in all supported browsers
- [ ] Configuration loads properly from the backend
- [ ] Messages are sent and received correctly
- [ ] Follow-up questions work as expected
- [ ] Domain validation functions correctly
- [ ] Embed code generates and works on external sites
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness works correctly
- [ ] Multiple widgets function independently for the same user

## Dependencies

- Backend API endpoints must be complete and functional
- WebSocket server must be properly configured
- Domain validation logic must be implemented in the backend

## Implementation Notes

- We are standardizing on `ChatWidgetWithConfig` for all new development
- The original `ChatWidget` is deprecated and will be removed in a future update
- All widget instances should be created using the `ChatWidget` export from `components/chat`
- The WebComponentWrapper needs further updates to fix type errors

## Conclusion

By following this implementation plan, we will have a fully functional, production-ready chat widget that supports multiple businesses and can be embedded on external sites.
